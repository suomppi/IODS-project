# Regression and model validation

I got through the data wrangling part, but I underestimated the time the analysis part took, and I couldn't get it finished in time. I will do the last parts in the weekend :D 
It was nice to get into action this week. The datacamp exercises were really helpful with this one. I used only the methods datacamp used so there shouldn't be anything too crazy going on in my file :)
