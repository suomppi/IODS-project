# About the project
I'm eager to start this course. This course was recommended to me by my thesis supervisor. I hope this helps me with **my thesis** and gives me tools for **doing research on my own.**

I'm also interested in coding generally. It's fascinating how much different things you can do eg: create **websites**, **apps**, **plots** and **analyze data**.


I have some experience with RStudio, but I'm pretty much still a *novice*.
